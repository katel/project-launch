## Project launch page

###About
This is a basic project launch page created in meteor.js. Listed adminstrators can sign in with Twitter to see a list of captured leads. 

Built with Zurb Foundation 5. Initial version based on this [Frozen Ridge demo](http://blog.mongolab.com/2013/05/build-your-own-lead-capture-page-with-meteor-and-mongolab-in-minutes/)

###Still to do
- Export to CSV
- Optional mailchimp integration
- More semantic market and default copy
